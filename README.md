# In this project titled **“Generative Text Model,”** I set out to design and implement a text generation system that can produce coherent, contextually relevant paragraphs based on user-provided prompts on specific topics. The main goal was to demonstrate how modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) models—particularly generative models like GPT—can be harnessed to create human-like text for a variety of real-world applications, such as creative writing, educational tools, chatbots, or automated content generation systems. To build this system, I chose to use the **pre-trained GPT-2 model** from the widely used Hugging Face `transformers` library. This model is renowned for its capability to generate fluent, natural-sounding language that often appears remarkably human. The primary deliverable of the project is an **interactive Jupyter Notebook** that walks users through the process: from installing dependencies and loading the model, to entering custom prompts and observing the resulting text generation. Throughout the project, I relied on several modern tools to streamline development, prototyping, and documentation. For coding and iterative testing, I used **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** as my integrated development environment. Its features, like built-in linting, Python extensions, and real-time debugging, significantly accelerated my workflow. To enhance the clarity and structure of the notebook, I turned to **ChatGPT** as an AI-based coding assistant. ChatGPT helped me design clean markdown cells, write clear function documentation, and craft Python code snippets for handling user input and customizing generation parameters such as temperature (which controls randomness) and max length (which controls output size). These parameters play a critical role in shaping the creativity and determinism of the generated text, which I demonstrated in the notebook by running several test cases. Additionally, I used **Bolt AI**, a tool that excels at quick prototyping and generating starter code, to scaffold the initial version of the notebook. Bolt AI helped me create the notebook’s skeleton, including code cells, markdown explanations, and sample prompts that illustrate how varying the temperature or prompt phrasing leads to different outputs. This saved time and provided a solid foundation, which I could then refine and expand manually in VS Code. By combining Bolt AI’s rapid generation capabilities with ChatGPT’s detailed guidance and VS Code’s robust development environment, I was able to build a notebook that is both technically sound and reader-friendly. The notebook itself starts with an introductory section explaining the basics of generative models and why GPT-based models are widely used for text generation tasks today. It then includes sections on installing the necessary Python libraries, importing the GPT-2 model, and defining functions to accept user prompts and generate text.
# In the core section, users can input their own topics or sentences and experiment with different generation settings to see how the outputs change. To demonstrate versatility, the notebook includes multiple prompts across different domains—such as technology, literature, and everyday scenarios—and shows how the model adapts its language style accordingly. An important part of the notebook is a discussion of **how temperature and max length** parameters influence the generation. Lower temperatures produce more focused and deterministic outputs, while higher temperatures encourage the model to be more creative and unexpected. This illustrates the trade-off between creativity and coherence, a central concept in text generation. The notebook ends with a brief reflection on the limitations of generative models—like occasional factual inaccuracies or repetitive text—and possible directions for improvement, such as fine-tuning on domain-specific datasets.

# By using a thoughtful combination of **VS Code**, **ChatGPT**, and **Bolt AI**, I was able to not only implement the Generative Text Model efficiently but also document and present it in an accessible way. This project highlights how AI tools can complement human effort to rapidly prototype, refine, and present sophisticated NLP applications that are both functional and easy to explore.
